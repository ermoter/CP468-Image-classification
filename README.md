## Descriction

We have worked on to create a project on the topic of Image Classification. The objective of our project is to classify images into different labels and identify them correctly with the maximum accuracy. We are able to acheive 87% accuracy in the end to train our model.


## Dataset

The dataset we chose for our problem was CIFAR10 dataset. It consists of 60000 32x32 colour images divided into 10 classes. It is split int 50000 training images and 10000 test images.


## Installation and Execution
To run Logistic_Regression.py, you will need to install

```bash
!pip install jovian --upgrade
!pip install pandas
!pip install torch
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install numpy
!pip install torchvision
```


To run Concolutional_neural_network.py, you will need to install

```bash
!pip install matplotlib
!pip install keras
!pip install tenserflow
```

## Performance Parameters

We trained our model using logistic regression which helped us to achieve an accuracy of around 45%, which is not we desire. Then using CNN, we were able to achieve a desirable accuracy of 87% in 12 minutes and by solving problem of data over-fitting.
